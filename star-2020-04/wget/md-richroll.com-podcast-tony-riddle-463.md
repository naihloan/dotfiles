*“We can’t all live in nature but that doesn’t mean we can’t all live
naturally.”*

Tony Riddle


Screens and cubicles. Shoes and chairs. Fluorescent lights and air
conditioned offices. Processed foods. Netflix and chill.

Disconnecting us from our essential human nature, modern living isn’t
making us happier. Ironically, it’s driving an existential crisis of
unprecedented proportions —  rendering us more sick, immobile, lonely,
depressed, and unfulfilled than ever.

It’s time to stop. It’s time we reconnect with that which is most
essential.

*Nature. Movement. Community. Love.*

To do that, we must adopt a more naturalistic approach to lifestyle.

This week’s guest calls it *rewilding.*

Meet **Tony Riddle** – a natural lifestyle coach and barefoot running
enthusiast who has devoted his life to studying what makes us human and
how to live naturally in the modern world. Through the adoption of
simple practices — many of which defined humanity for millennia — he
aids people in living healthier and more connected lives by changing our
relationship to ourselves, to others and our personal environments.

Putting his life philosophy into action, Tony is attempting to run the
entire length of Great Britain, **barefoot.** Beginning September 1 at
Land’s End, he will run 900 miles — 30 miles a day for 30 consecutive
days — until he reaches John O’Groats, convening with sustainability
experts along the way. To learn more, join him for a segment or
otherwise get involved, visit [tonyriddle.com.](http://tonyriddle.com.)

\
I was initially  introduced to Tony through [The Happy
Pear](https://www.richroll.com/?s=happy+pear) twins. Enamored with his
instructional Instagram tutorials on natural lifestyle practices, I knew
he’d make for a fun and highly instructive podcast.

My day with Tony began with a running technique tutorial, followed by a
trail run (which Tony did barefoot of course, to my amazement given the
sharp rocky terrain), and culminated in this conversation.

As an aside, please check out the fun and informative video we created
from my run with Tony. It’s called [You’ve Been Running
Wrong.](https://www.richroll.com/blog/youve-been-running-wrong/) Shout
out to [Ali Rogers](http://pranalens.com) for a bang up job directing
and editing

This is a conversation about the importance of getting back to what
works best for our bodies by deepening our natural and ancient
connection to ourselves, to others and our environments. It begins with
getting outdoors. But it extends from there — to movement, to food (of
course), sleep, digestion, parenting, play, and even the
re-configuration of our homes and workplaces.

**Tony’s Tutorials:** As a gesture of thanks for listening, Tony set up
a special discount on his squat and running video tutorials.

naturally and mindfully. Enjoy!
