TLDR; My choice: **Python.** Why? Python is at the perfect intersection
of the **most paid, easiest, and highly trending** (overtook Java in
popularity in 2016)**.**

If you’re more of a video person, here’s my take on why Python is
awesome. Prefer to read? No problem! Scroll on.

It can feel overwhelming when you try to pick a programming language to
learn. You have so many choices — and there are a lot of factors to
consider. How hard is the language to learn? How in demand is it? What
can you use it for? It’s INSANE. I know.

You can see at the bottom left that Python has an **average salary of
\$107,000**, it’s **highly popular,** and has the **easiest**
difficulty**.**

People often ask me

**But Qazi, Who uses Python!?**

Well, that’s a great question…

The biggest companies use python.
=================================

You might know a few of these ;).

Aren’t these pictures so pretty? I just love it.

Let me show you a few more. Some say pictures are worth a thousand
words. I say **these pictures could be worth about \$107,000 for you**
❤.

Python overtook Java in popularity in 2016.
===========================================

You can see the red line of python racing past every other language.

Last picture of the day, I promise!

**Python is the top language at the best universities**. Why? Because
it’s the easiest and has the most room for growth. Think going from
**1st grade to NASA, Python is capable of it all**.

The time will come when you need to know multiple languages… Every
developer does.

But, it’s best to **start with ONE language and learn it well**. Then
you can explore and becoming good at other languages.

Remember, your focus is to learn the concepts in the start while
building real stuff. **Python does a good job of staying out of your way
and letting you build powerful things**.

Comment I saw on Reddit

What does this mean for you? Your journey to becoming a software
developer is not easy, but it’s simple.

You can think of it like this. Learning computer programming is like
learning a language. You want to start with a super easy language to
pick up before you move onto learning more languages.

So, to answer the fun question of what programming should you learn
first? I would recommend learning python. SHOCKING. I know. But, it
genuinely is the best language to start with first and I back it 739%.
