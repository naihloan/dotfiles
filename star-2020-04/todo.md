Hi Michael,
I hope you are doing well.

This is just a personal email to see if you are doing well.
I understand that in Germany COVID is somewhat controlled, but still I wanted to check in and know how you are.
Please do tell me that you are doing ok.
That's all.

We'll be chatting soon again.
Best wishes,

Start Time of a Caption Group

The start time should align with the beginning of the sound. This applies to both atmospherics and speech.
While the video plays, press the UP arrow key on your keyboard to align the start of a caption group precisely when the first word or sound of a caption group is heard.
Note: When you press the UP arrow key, Dash automatically bumps your timestamp forward by 1/4 second to compensate for normal lag in human reaction time.
